* **Climate Action**: Build on the Green New Deal to create comprehensive climate solutions that are good for the planet and the US economy.   
* **New Leadership**: After 20+ terms, it's time for fresh voices to correct the direction we are heading. We need representatives that fight for their constituents ‚Äì not corporate interests.
